# data_utilities

This is a python app setup to run as a google cloud function. In order to test locally you need to setup a local gcloud environment and use the functions_framework package.

Deploy with "gcloud functions deploy marketing_data_etl_function --gen2 --entry-point=import_data"

There are tutorials and examples of how to do this here:
